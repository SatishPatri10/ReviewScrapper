realme,DASHRATH  KUMAR,4,Pretty good,Camera is good but it doesn't have wide angle camera. Night vision camera is better than many phones. Screen brightness should be a lil bit more to be use in sunny days. I'm missing super amoled display. No lag and processor performance is like butter. Slightly heating during charging and BGMI playing Overall nice phone.
